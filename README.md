# Tata Trusts- India Justice Report
Ranking Indian states based on their performance on - Police, Prisons, Judiciary and Legal Aid.

Tata Trust funded India Justice report is the first of its kind study that ranked Indian states based 
on their performance on four pillars of justice - police, prisons, judiciary and legal aid. For this project, 
I gathered data from BPR&D annual reports (Bureau or Police Research and Development), Prison Statistics India (PSI), 
NALSA (National Legal Services Authority), State budget documents, Comptroller and Auditor General of India annual 
audit reports, and Census 2011. Most of the data was collected for 5-7 years to enable comparison of performance over 
a time frame. The data was small enough to reside in excel sheets. 

All the calculations to build indicators from raw data were done in R studio.

Each .rmd file is named after a pillar. It containts all the data/indicator calculations with respect to that pillar. 
The ranking bit is not included in the code files here because at the time I was still finding my way with R, so I used excel 
to calculate ranks based on scoring for each state.

Unfortunately, I can't make public the excel sheets that stores all the datasets as that bit is bound by contract.
